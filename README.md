# San Diego Water Quality Project

In this data analysis project, volunteer data analysts are studying a range of
public dataset to explore San Diego county water quality issues, such as beach
closures and stream impairment. Volunteers join the project to learn new
data analysis skills, get detailed knowledge of environmental issues, or to
contribute to improving San Diego's natural resources. Anyone is welcome to
participate in the project.

_Current Work_: 10 Oct to 19 Nov, we are working on making submissions for a [Water Quality Data Visualization Challenge.](https://github.com/san-diego-water-quality/water-quality-project/wiki/SFEI-Visualization-Contest) 

# Getting Started

If you'd like to join the project:

* Join the [Mailing List/Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sandiegodata.org/forum/#!forum/water)
* Attend a [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Regional-Data-Library/)

After setting up your account, you should: 

* Read the [past project news.](https://redmine.civicknowledge.com/projects/san-diego-water-quality/news)
* Study some of the example Jupyter notebooks for [temporal correlations](https://github.com/san-diego-water-quality/ericbusboom/blob/master/Beachwatch%20station%20correlations.ipynb) or [logistic regression](https://github.com/san-diego-water-quality/ericbusboom/blob/master/Beachwatch%20Logistic.ipynb) or [other examples](https://github.com/san-diego-water-quality/water-datasets/blob/master/derived/sandiegodata.org-beachwatch/notebooks/Examples.ipynb)
* Find a [ticket to work on.](https://redmine.civicknowledge.com/projects/san-diego-water-quality/issues)
* [Come to the monthly meetings](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Regional-Data-Library/) to show of your work, or to learn from others. 
* [Schedule office hours](https://www.sandiegodata.org/office-hours/) with the project manager, Eric Busboom, if you need more detailed help.

# Datasets

The ``water-project`` tag in our [Data Repository](https://data.sandiegodata.org/dataset?tags=water-project) has all of the released datasets. 

The two most important are: 
* [San Diego Beachwatch Data, With Features](https://data.sandiegodata.org/dataset/sandiegodata-org-beachwatch)
* [Tides, River Flow and Rain](https://data.sandiegodata.org/dataset/sandiegodata-org-water_quality)

All of the datsets can be built from source from our [github repo.](https://github.com/san-diego-water-quality/water-datasets)
