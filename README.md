# San Diego Water Quality Project

In this data analysis project, volunteer data analysts are studying a range of
public dataset to explore San Diego county water quality issues, such as beach
closures and stream impairment. Volunteers join the the project to learn new
data analysis skills, get detailed knowledge of environmental issues, or to
contribute to improving San Diego's natural resources. Anyone is welcome to
participate in the project.

If you'd like to join, see the [guide on joining data library projects](https://www.sandiegodata.org/projects/join/).
